BRUINEXPRESS

Solo Project by Rishabh Jain

The backend is in the form of Django, and is fully uploaded for visualizing
the algorithm used to push data to users.

However, most of the frontend code is redacted. The main App.js file is 
available though, but it uses custom dependencies created by me which I'm 
not ready to publicly release yet.
